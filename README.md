JS-drills-and-sample-apps
=========================

Small projects that explore javascript and related front-end tech.

These mini-apps were built using Grunt, the JavaScript task runner, which requires node.js. You can install Grunt using the node package manager.

To run (unless otherwise instructed):
<ul>
  <li>Install Grunt cli globally: `npm install -g grunt-cli` </li>
  <li>run `grunt` to create a local public/ directory</li>
  <li>open public/index.html and take a look!
</ul>
